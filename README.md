## Description

**GUI** based currency converter that has the _latest rates_ and supports more than _150 currencies_. The **GUI** was made with [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) and the rates and the conversion is made by [exchange.host](https://exchangerate.host/#/), a free service **API** that provides free current and historical exchange rates & crypto exchange rates.

Attached below is an image of the interface. It's quite straight-forward, after selecting the currencies and amount, press the **Convert** button to make the conversion or the **Clear** button to reset it. The **Exit** button will terminate the program.

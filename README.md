# Description

Calculates the conversion between two given currencies. It has a simple, straight-forward **GUI** made with [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html).
The conversion rates are up-to-date, provided by [exchangerate.host](https://exchangerate.host/#/docs). 

# How It Works

Attached below is the interface of the converter. 

 - To use it, select the currencies from the _dropdown menus__, add the amount and press the **convert** button. 
 - The **clear** button will reset the _amount_, _conversion rate_ and the _output_ boxes. 
 - The **exit** button will terminate the program.
